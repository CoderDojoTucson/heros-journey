# heros-journey
An HTML game to explore the steps of the hero's journey while writing a story.

This Canvas game will display prompts for the steps along the Hero's Journey as you click the circles on the map. Numbered circles are required steps, lettered circles are optional steps. Each prompt is meant to assist you in developing the next paragraph or two in your story. You can also use this method for game narrative writing.

Have fun!

_The gameboard and descriptions of the steps along the Hero's Journey came from a workshop by Arn&eacute;e Flores at the 2023 Tucson Festival of Books. Please check out her work on [her website](https://www.arneeflores.com/)._
